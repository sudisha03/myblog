Iâ€™m a full-time inbound marketing specialist with expertise in content marketing, communications, and multimedia production. Interested in writing factual stories about the subaltern, technology, rural India, female empowerment, and global health.

I love creating content- be it textual, visual, or graphic.

In some ways, the field of content creation has rescued me. What started as a part-time job in college (writing SEO-friendly content for websites) has now snowballed into a full-time career for me.
